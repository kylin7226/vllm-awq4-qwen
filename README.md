## 📋 Project overview

This is a **Docker-based deployment and benchmarking project** for running the **Qwen 3.6-27B language model** (quantized to AWQ-INT4) on **AMD Strix Halo** hardware (gfx1151 / RDNA 3.5 integrated GPU). It is not a library or framework — it is a self-contained infrastructure repo that builds vLLM from source with hardware-specific patches, then serves the model through an OpenAI-compatible API.

The headline achievement: **24.8 tokens/sec peak** single-stream decode throughput (with DFlash speculative decoding), a +340% improvement over the no-speculative baseline of 5.6 t/s, on a fanless consumer integrated GPU.

### Architecture

| Layer | Component | Detail |
|---|---|---|
| Model | Qwen 3.6-27B (cyankiwi AWQ-INT4, W4A16, group_size 32) | ~14 GiB on disk; vision blocks kept BF16 |
| Inference engine | vLLM v0.20.0 (built from source) | OpenAI-compatible API on port 8000 |
| GPU | AMD Strix Halo / gfx1151 / RDNA 3.5 (iGPU) | 128 GB UMA pool, GTT-on-demand |
| GPU stack | TheRock ROCm 7.13 nightly | Non-official nightly build from `rocm.nightlies.amd.com` |
| Deep learning | PyTorch 2.10 + Triton 3.6 (ROCm nightly) | gfx1151-specific wheel index |
| Speculative decoding | DFlash (`z-lab/Qwen3.6-27B-DFlash`, ~2B BF16) | N=8 speculative tokens; drafter has 4 SWA + 1 full attention layers |
| AWQ kernels | `conch-triton-kernels` | Required for AWQMarlin-on-ROCm path |
| Containerization | Docker Compose | Single service, `--enforce-eager` (HIP graphs freeze on gfx1151) |
| CLI client | `glados.py` — pure Python stdlib | REPL + one-shot + benchmark, SSE streaming via `/v1/responses` |

### What the server provides

Three OpenAI-compatible endpoints:

- **`/v1/chat/completions`** — Standard chat completion API with thinking mode, vision, and tool calling (non-streaming recommended for tools due to upstream parser bugs)
- **`/v1/responses`** — OpenAI Responses API with reasoning/text channels separated via SSE streaming (the preferred endpoint for agents and streaming reasoning)
- **`/v1/completions`** — Raw text completion

Model capabilities: 256K native context (232K usable after vLLM padding), vision/image input (ViT tower preserved at BF16), tool calling via the `qwen3_coder` parser, and thinking/reasoning mode with `` token separation.

### Deliberately excluded

- Flash-Attention (2.2-3.7x ViT regression on gfx1151)
- AITER custom build (disabled at runtime via `VLLM_ROCM_USE_AITER=0`; CDNA-only kernels)
- bitsandbytes ROCm (AWQ via compressed-tensors instead)
- Custom RCCL (single iGPU, no NCCL needed)
- HIP graph capture (documented freeze class on gfx1151)

## ⚡ The numbers

| | Single-stream t/s | Hardware |
|---|---|---|
| 🟩 *DGX Spark FP8 baseline (no spec)* | 7.8 | NVIDIA GB10 Blackwell |
| 🟩 *Our BF16 sibling repo, no spec* | 4.3 | AMD Strix Halo |
| 🟩 *Our AWQ4, no spec (this repo, baseline)* | 5.6 | AMD Strix Halo |
| 🟧 *DGX Spark FP8 + DFlash + MTP (claimed)* | 20-25 | NVIDIA GB10 Blackwell |
| 🟥 **Our AWQ4 + DFlash N=8 (this repo)** | **24.8 peak / 18.5 mean** | **AMD Strix Halo** |
| ⚪ *DGX Spark NVFP4 + DFlash, Blackwell-locked* | 83.9 median | NVIDIA GB10 sm_121a only |

> **+340% over no-spec baseline** - *5.6 → 24.8 t/s* on `/v1/responses`, single-stream, full 256K context, on a fanless integrated GPU.

### 📈 Prefill (input processing) speed

Decode speed is what most people measure. How fast the engine ingests the prompt before the first token streams, from `/metrics`:

| Metric | Value | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Per-request prefill avg | **33-38 t/s** | realistic, includes prompt-with-tools, under reasoning + concurrency contention |
| Instantaneous prefill peaks | **100-400 t/s** | 10-second scheduler windows when GPU is dedicated to prefill (e.g. fresh request burst) |
| 8K-token solo prefill | ~3-4 min | dominated by prefill, decoding ~300 output tokens after |
| 8K-token × 3 parallel | **>10 min, hits client timeout** | KV cache pool fills, prefill chunks interleave with decode of other streams |

**Right number to plan with: ~38 t/s.** The 100-400 t/s scheduler heartbeats are real but instantaneous bursts that don't last more than a few seconds. The user-perceived "how long until the model starts replying to my long prompt" question is governed by the per-request average, not the burst peak. Source: vLLM `vllm:request_prefill_time_seconds_sum / vllm:request_prompt_tokens_sum`, accumulated across all real workloads in our session.

## ✅ What works

| Feature | Status |
|---|---|
| 🟢 `/v1/chat/completions` | full chat with thinking |
| 🟢 `/v1/responses` | reasoning-parser separates `<think>` from output |
| 🟢 `/v1/completions` | raw text completion |
| 🟢 Vision (image input) | ViT on `TRITON_ATTN`, LM on `ROCM_ATTN` + DFlash |
| 🟢 256K context | full `--max-model-len 262144`, ~232K usable after vLLM padding |
| 🟢 DFlash speculative decoding | N=1, N=4, N=8 all tested |
| 🟢 SWA in DFlash drafter | PR #40898 cherry-pick handles interleaved sliding-window |
| 🔴 HIP graphs | freezes on gfx1151, kept off via `--enforce-eager` |
| 🔴 `Qwen/Qwen3.6-27B-FP8` | Triton w8a8 autotune stall on hybrid model |

### 🛠️ Tool calling support matrix

The streaming-vs-non-streaming behavior is the part most people get wrong. To be unambiguous:

| Endpoint | `stream: false` (wait for full JSON) | `stream: true` (SSE deltas) |
|---|---|---|
| `/v1/chat/completions` + tools | 🟢 **works** - `qwen3_coder` parser produces clean `tool_calls` array. Verified 9 / 9 across single + parallel + multi-tool + round-trip. | 🟡 **buggy** - upstream parser bug (vLLM PRs #40783, #40785, #40787 unmerged). Avoid. |
| `/v1/responses` + tools | 🔴 **broken when combined with `enable_thinking=false`** - tool-call XML lands raw in the `reasoning` field, no `function_call` item parsed. Architectural fix not in this repo. | 🟢 **works** - `function_call` items emitted as proper `response.output_item.added/done` events. Verified across tiny + 2K context, with reasoning on or off. **This is the recommended path for agents.** |

**TL;DR for client builders**: agents that need tool calls should use either `/v1/chat/completions` with `stream: false`, OR `/v1/responses` with `stream: true`. Avoid the other two diagonals.

### ⏱️ Spin-up time is ~9 min on every restart (even with all caches warm)

This is the planning number for any `docker compose up`. We measured 8m27s, 8m44s, 8m37s across reboots in this session - the magic number is **~9 min**, regardless of whether the host page cache, Triton kernel cache, and Linux disk cache are warm. The breakdown matches every boot we ran:

```
~95 s   Model load                  target weights (14 GB AWQ4) + DFlash drafter (3.3 GB BF16)
                                    from disk; faster on warm page cache, slower on first
                                    boot after host reboot.
~6-7 m  profile_run + autotune      vLLM runs synthetic max-batch forward passes to size
                                    the KV cache pool, JITs Triton kernels, and wires up
                                    the DFlash speculative pipeline + SWA causal metadata.
                                    This is the dominant cost and it runs every time.
~5 s    Server startup              FastAPI + Uvicorn + /health green.
                                    ----------
~9 min total
```

**What is and isn't cached across restarts:**

| Component | Persisted to host? | Saves on restart? |
|---|---|---|
| Triton compiled kernels | ✅ via `./.triton-cache/` mount | partial (~30 s saved on second boot at same config) |
| Triton autotune choices | ⚠ same dir, recompute is fast | minor |
| MIOpen solver database | ❌ not host-mounted | nothing (re-searches every boot; `MIOPEN_FIND_MODE=FAST` mitigates) |
| DFlash drafter wiring | ❌ rebuilt every boot | nothing |
| `profile_run` forward passes | ❌ must run every boot | nothing |
| Model weights → page cache | ✅ Linux page cache | huge if you don't `drop_caches` between |

**Even a "warm" restart costs ~8.5 min** (we measured exactly this). The Triton cache helps modestly; the dominant ~7 min is the engine doing real GPU work to validate the configuration is OK to serve. There is no shortcut that doesn't carry OOM risk - `--num-gpu-blocks-override` would skip the memory probe (~1-2 min) but pins the KV block count to a stale config the moment any related env var changes, leading to silent OOM at runtime.

**Practical implications:**
- Restart is roughly the cost of a coffee. Plan it.
- **`.env` changes require `docker compose down && up -d`**, NOT `docker compose restart`. `restart` reuses the running container and never re-reads the env file. We hit this bumping `VLLM_MAX_NUM_SEQS` 1→3 and the engine kept reporting `max_num_seqs=1` until a full down + up cycle. Image rebuilds (`docker compose build`) are also `down + up`, not `restart`.
- Treat the engine as a long-lived daily-driver service. The "9-min restart" is paying for safety (profile_run validates the entire pipeline runs without crashing), not waste.

---

### 🧩 Recommended setup for multi-tenant / RAG / agent serving

**Profile we run as the daily driver** (also the one used for the multi-stream stress test below):

| Setting | Value | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| `VLLM_MAX_NUM_SEQS` | `3` | three independent clients can decode at the same time (chat UI + RAG api + automation client) |
| `VLLM_MAX_MODEL_LEN` | `131072` | half the native 256K context  -  cuts KV cache budget in half so each of the three slots gets ~7.87 GiB |
| `VLLM_GPU_MEMORY_UTIL` | `0.5` | sets a 64 GiB cap on what vLLM may claim. **Actual measured idle footprint ≈ 50 GiB** (49.7 GiB GTT + ~0.8 GiB dedicated VRAM, read from `/sys/class/drm/card1/device/mem_info_*` on the running engine), leaving ~75 GiB of the 128 GB UMA pool free for sibling services on the same box |

We **lowered `gpu_memory_utilization` from the default `0.9` to `0.5` and dropped `max_model_len` from `262144` to `131072`** specifically to share the box: vLLM no longer hoards VRAM, and 128K is more than enough context for almost any realistic tool-calling agent or RAG retrieval window.

**What this fits alongside vLLM on the same Strix Halo box** (verified running concurrently):
- this vLLM instance serving Qwen 3.6-27B
- a RAG api stack (FastAPI + pgvector + 2× HuggingFace text-embeddings-inference + memgraph) - **CPU-only**
- a Piper TTS-backed web UI ([gladosproject](https://github.com/hec-ovi/gladosproject)) - **CPU-only**

All three coexist without OOM or contention because only vLLM uses the iGPU; the embedding/reranker models and Piper TTS run on CPU and don't compete for the UMA pool.

**Important: only the streaming path on `/v1/responses` is patched.** The local Patch 15 fix in this repo wires `chat_template_kwargs.enable_thinking=false` through to the chat-template renderer on the streaming code path of `/v1/responses` only. The non-streaming path (`stream: false`) on `/v1/responses` still has a separate, deeper routing bug (output text and tool-call XML land in the `reasoning` field instead of `output_text` / `function_call` items). That bug requires a different, larger architectural patch which is **out of scope for this repo**. Build agents and clients against `/v1/responses` with `stream: true` and the engine behaves correctly; do not use `stream: false` on `/v1/responses` if you have set `enable_thinking=false`. See [Verified streaming behavior with Patch 15](#-verified-streaming-behavior-with-patch-15) for the test matrix.

---

### 🤝 Multi-stream + tool calling stress test (3 concurrent)

We tested with `max_num_seqs=3` to verify the engine handles concurrent multi-agent workloads, since this is the realistic scenario when serving a RAG api, a chat UI, and an automation client off the same vLLM box. Results from this session:

| Round | Test shape | Tool calls per response | Result |
|---|---|---|---|
| A | 3 parallel requests, each asks `get_weather` for 3 different cities | **3 parallel calls** in one response | 9 / 9 succeeded; cities + args correct |
| B | 3 parallel requests, each combines `calculate` + `search_web` in one ask | **2 different tools** in one response | 9 / 9 succeeded; both tools called with valid JSON args |
| C | 3 parallel requests, each combines complex multi-param `book_flight` (5 fields incl. enum + ISO date) + `get_weather` | **2 tools, 5+ args each** in one response | 9 / 9 succeeded; all required + optional params populated |
| D | Full round-trip: send tool calls back as `function_call_output` items, get final synthesized answer | n/a (assembling tool results) | clean natural-language answer using both tool results, even called out a count discrepancy ("only 2 results despite requesting 5") |

**Findings**:
- `parallel_tool_calls: true` works on `/v1/responses`. Same-tool fan-out (Round A) and different-tool combo (Round B/C) both verified.
- Three concurrent streams hit `Running: 3 reqs, Waiting: 0` in the scheduler. Per-stream decode held at ~13.5 t/s (vs ~18 t/s solo). Aggregate peaked at **41 t/s**.
- **Zero engine errors observed** across all 9 + 1 round-trip requests. `vllm:request_success_total{finished_reason="error"} = 0`.
- Tool call args validated: integer fields are integers, enums are valid values, ISO dates parsed correctly. The `qwen3_coder` tool-call parser handles non-streaming round-trips cleanly.
- `chat_template_kwargs.enable_thinking=false` was set on every request but the model still produced reasoning. **This was the gap that motivated local Patch 15** (see [What we contributed](#%EF%B8%8F-what-we-contributed)). After the patch, the kwarg routes through correctly and reasoning is genuinely skipped on `/v1/responses` streaming.

This is enough proof that the same vLLM instance can serve **a multi-agent / multi-client setup** (e.g. one process orchestrating an agentic graph of 3 simultaneous reasoning workers, each calling tools) without queueing or correctness issues. Use the **3-agent multi-stream profile** in [Tunable env vars](#tunable-env-vars-env-overrides) above.

### Reasoning intensity limitation (Qwen3.6 specific)

Qwen3.6 tends to **over-reason** even on trivial tool-routing prompts. We saw same-class prompts produce reasoning anywhere from ~400 chars (terse) to **2,075 chars** (verbose) - that variance is the dominant source of wall-time noise across our concurrent tests, not decode speed. TTFT histograms therefore look bimodal (some requests start streaming visible content in 5 s, others take 60+ s while the model thinks). If your downstream UI surfaces TTFT as a single number, expect it to be noisy on this model. **If you don't want reasoning at all**, send `chat_template_kwargs: {"enable_thinking": false}` on `/v1/responses` (streaming) or `/v1/chat/completions`  -  Patch 15 in this repo wires the kwarg through the responses path that vLLM upstream silently dropped. See [Verified streaming behavior with Patch 15](#-verified-streaming-behavior-with-patch-15).

### DFlash acceptance scaling (vLLM internal metrics)

The drafter is **genuinely guessing the right tokens**, not just running and getting rejected:

| Spec tokens N | Mean accepted / round | Avg acceptance | Per-stream t/s (steady) |
|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| 0 (no spec) | n/a | n/a | 5.64 |
| 1 | 1.52 | 52% | 8.95 |
| 4 | 3.20 | 64% | 17.92 |
| 8 | 5.64 to 6.35 | 51-67% (varies by content) | 19.80 (chat) / **24.80 (responses)** |

Per-position acceptance falls off as N grows (drafter is less confident predicting 8 tokens ahead than 4). Position-0 stays in the 83-95% range  -  i.e. the very next token is almost always right.

## 🚀 Quick start

<details>
<summary><b>Click to expand  -  full install in ≈ 30-40 min</b></summary>

### 1. Hardware required
- AMD Ryzen AI Max+ 395 "Strix Halo" or compatible gfx1151 iGPU
- 128 GB UMA (BIOS UMA frame buffer set to **2 GB minimum**, *not* maxed)
- Linux host with `/dev/kfd` + `/dev/dri` exposed to Docker
- ≥ 100 GB free disk for models + caches

### 2. Host setup (one-time)

#### BIOS
Set the dedicated GPU VRAM carve-out to its **minimum (2 GB / 2048 MB)**.
Menu varies: *UMA Frame Buffer Size*, *iGPU Memory*, *GPU Shared Memory*. You want GTT-on-demand, not fixed pre-alloc.

#### GRUB (raise TTM page limit so the GPU can map ~116 GiB of GTT)
```bash
sudo nano /etc/default/grub
# set:
GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="quiet splash ttm.pages_limit=30408704 amdgpu.noretry=0 amdgpu.gpu_recovery=1"
sudo update-grub
sudo reboot

# verify after reboot:
cat /sys/class/drm/card1/device/mem_info_gtt_total
# expect ~124554670080 (≈ 116 GiB)
```

### 3. Accept HF gated-model terms (manual, blocking)
The DFlash drafter is gated on Hugging Face  -  you must click "Agree" once:
- ➡️ **<https://huggingface.co/z-lab/Qwen3.6-27B-DFlash>** ← log in, accept conditions

The target model `cyankiwi/Qwen3.6-27B-AWQ-INT4` is ungated.

### 4. Clone + configure
```bash
git clone <this-repo>
cd vllm-awq4-qwen
cp .env.template .env
nano .env
# set:
#   VLLM_HOST_MODELS_DIR=/path/to/your/hf/cache
#   HF_TOKEN=hf_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx     # from https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens
```

### 5. Pre-download both models (in parallel)
```bash
export $(grep -E '^(HF_TOKEN|VLLM_HOST_MODELS_DIR)=' .env | xargs)
HF_HUB_ENABLE_HF_TRANSFER=1 hf download cyankiwi/Qwen3.6-27B-AWQ-INT4 --cache-dir "$VLLM_HOST_MODELS_DIR/hub" &
HF_HUB_ENABLE_HF_TRANSFER=1 hf download z-lab/Qwen3.6-27B-DFlash       --cache-dir "$VLLM_HOST_MODELS_DIR/hub" &
wait
# ≈ 14 GB target + ≈ 3.3 GB drafter
```

### 6. Build the Docker image (≈ 25-35 min, one-time)
```bash
docker compose build
```
Multi-stage: TheRock ROCm 7.13 nightly tarball → PyTorch from `rocm.nightlies.amd.com/v2-staging/gfx1151/` → vLLM v0.20.0 source → 20 idempotent string-replace patches → C/HIP extensions for gfx1151.

### 7. Boot the engine
```bash
docker compose up -d
docker logs -f vllm-awq4-qwen
# wait for: "Application startup complete"
# cold start ≈ 8-10 min (Triton JIT compiles ROCM_ATTN + DFlash kernels)
# warm restart < 30 s (kernel cache persisted to ./.triton-cache)
```

### 8. Talk to it
```bash
curl http://127.0.0.1:8000/v1/chat/completions \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"model":"Qwen3.6-27B-AWQ4","messages":[{"role":"user","content":"hi"}]}'
```

### Tunable env vars (.env overrides)
| var | default | meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `VLLM_DFLASH_N` | `8` | speculative tokens; higher = more parallelism, lower acceptance past ~8 |
| `VLLM_GPU_MEMORY_UTIL` | `0.9` | KV cache budget |
| `VLLM_MAX_NUM_SEQS` | `1` | bump to 3-10 for aggregate throughput (3 verified, see profiles below) |
| `VLLM_MAX_MODEL_LEN` | `262144` | full Qwen 256K (drop to 131072 for half the KV cost) |
| `VLLM_MODEL_ID` | `cyankiwi/Qwen3.6-27B-AWQ-INT4` | target model |

### Recommended profiles

| Profile | `MAX_NUM_SEQS` | `MAX_MODEL_LEN` | `GPU_MEMORY_UTIL` | Budget cap (util × UMA) | Use case |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Single-user, max context** | `1` | `262144` | `0.9` | ~115 GiB cap | one chat at a time, full 256K |
| **3-agent multi-stream** ⭐ | `3` | `131072` | `0.5` | **~64 GiB cap** (measured idle: ~50 GiB) | 3 simultaneous clients, 128K each, leaves room on the box for a RAG api / embedding service / TTS / etc. |
| Aggressive 3-up | `3` | `131072` | `0.7` | ~90 GiB cap | 3 clients with more KV headroom (~120K usable per stream) |

> The "Budget cap" column is `gpu_memory_utilization × UMA pool size (128 GiB)`. It's a *ceiling*, not a target. Actual claimed memory is whatever vLLM's `profile_run` plus model weights plus KV cache pool actually need, which is usually well below the cap.

**3-agent profile, what we ran today:** vLLM at `max_num_seqs=3, max_model_len=131072, gpu_memory_utilization=0.5` reports `Available KV cache memory: 23.61 GiB`, `GPU KV cache size: 82,368 tokens`. **Actual measured idle footprint: ~50 GiB** (49.7 GiB GTT + ~0.8 GiB dedicated VRAM, sysfs at `/sys/class/drm/card1/device/mem_info_gtt_used` and `mem_info_vram_used`). Breakdown: model weights ~28 GiB + KV pool 23.61 GiB ≈ 51 GiB; the cap is 64 GiB so ~14 GiB of headroom is left unclaimed within the cap. Verified with three concurrent clients: this vLLM serving Qwen, a RAG api stack on the same box (FastAPI + pgvector + 2× HuggingFace text-embeddings-inference on CPU + memgraph), and a piper TTS-backed web UI ([gladosproject](https://github.com/hec-ovi/gladosproject)). All three coexist without OOM or contention because:

- Embedding/reranker models run **CPU-only** (HF TEI `cpu-1.9` image)
- Piper TTS runs **CPU-only** (`PiperVoice.load(use_cuda=False)` is the default; we don't override) - confirmed by inspecting `piper.voice` source
- Only vLLM uses the iGPU, so the CPU-bound services don't compete for the 128 GiB UMA pool

## 🥗 Cross-quant quality reference

We didn't run quality benchmarks ourselves  -  these are **published numbers** from each model's official source:

| Variant | Source | Headline benchmarks | Quality vs BF16 |
|---|---|---|---|
| Qwen3.6-27B BF16 (base) | [Qwen / HF](https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen3.6-27B) | MMLU-Pro **86.2** • GPQA Diamond **87.8** • LiveCodeBench v6 **83.9** • SWE-bench Verified **77.2** • C-Eval **91.4** | reference |
| Qwen3.6-27B-FP8 (official) | [Qwen / HF](https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen3.6-27B-FP8) | "fine-grained FP8, block-128" | *"performance metrics nearly identical to those of the original model"*  -  Qwen team |
| **Qwen3.6-27B-AWQ-INT4 (cyankiwi) ← used here** | [HF model card](https://huggingface.co/cyankiwi/Qwen3.6-27B-AWQ-INT4) | compressed-tensors W4A16 g32, MSE observer, asymmetric, **vision blocks excluded from quant** | typical AWQ INT4 g32: < 1% MMLU loss per AWQ paper |
| Qwen3.6-27B-Q8_0 (Unsloth GGUF) | [HF GGUF](https://huggingface.co/unsloth/Qwen3.6-27B-GGUF) | 28.6 GB | "essentially lossless" per [Unsloth Dynamic 2.0 docs](https://unsloth.ai/docs/basics/unsloth-dynamic-v2.0-gguf) |

**Why we picked AWQ-INT4 g32:**
- ~14 GiB on disk (smallest near-lossless quant for Qwen 3.6-27B)
- Vision blocks kept BF16 (cyankiwi's `quantization_config.ignore` excludes the visual tower) → multimodal stays full-precision
- Auto-detected by vLLM via `quant_method: compressed-tensors` (no manual `--quantization` flag needed)

## 🛠️ What we contributed

We don't fork vLLM. We cherry-pick two upstream PRs and add one local fix, all as idempotent string-replace patches in `scripts/patch_strix.py`:

<details>
<summary><b>Patch 13  -  PR #40176 cherry-pick (ROCm DFlash on gfx1151)</b></summary>

- **Upstream**: [vllm-project/vllm#40176](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/pull/40176) by AMD's [@micah-wil](https://github.com/micah-wil), merged 2026-04-22 to main (commit `6d09769700`)
- **Why we patch**: v0.20.0 was tagged 2026-04-23 from a release branch that *did not* back-port this merge.
- **Diff**: 41+ / 13- across 4 files
  - `vllm/v1/attention/backends/rocm_attn.py`  -  `causal: bool` field, `supports_non_causal()=True` (no arch gate)
  - `vllm/v1/attention/ops/prefix_prefill.py`  -  `CAUSAL: tl.constexpr` parameter to `_fwd_kernel`, branched K-range and mask logic
  - `vllm/v1/attention/ops/chunked_prefill_paged_decode.py`  -  `causal=` plumbing
  - `vllm/v1/attention/backends/rocm_aiter_unified_attn.py`  -  explicit `supports_non_causal()=False`
- **Effect**: vLLM allows DFlash to run on `ROCM_ATTN` on gfx1151. Without this, DFlash refuses to load (`supports_non_causal=False`).

<details>
<summary><b>Patch 14  -  PR #40898 cherry-pick (SWA support in DFlash drafter)</b></summary>

- **Upstream**: [vllm-project/vllm#40898](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/pull/40898) by [@jianc99](https://github.com/jianc99) (DFlash paper author + drafter publisher)  -  **OPEN as of 2026-04-26**
- **Why we patch**: drafter author explicitly recommends installing this PR for vanilla vLLM compatibility with the `z-lab/Qwen3.6-27B-DFlash` drafter (4 sliding + 1 full attention layers).
- **Diff**: 156+ / 1- across 4 files
  - `vllm/model_executor/models/qwen3_dflash.py`  -  `_get_dflash_layer_types`, `sliding_window` threading, `sliding_attention_layer_names` set
  - `vllm/transformers_utils/configs/speculators/algos.py`  -  preserves `layer_types`, `sliding_window` etc.
  - `vllm/v1/spec_decode/dflash.py`  -  per-layer `causal=True` metadata for SWA layers
  - **`vllm/v1/worker/gpu_model_runner.py`  -  `target_layer_ids` `+1` shift fix** (this is a **correctness bug**, not just optimization  -  without it the drafter reads the wrong target hidden states and acceptance plummets)
- **Verified live**: engine logs show `Using auxiliary layers from speculative config: (2, 17, 32, 47, 62)`  -  the drafter's `target_layer_ids: [1, 16, 31, 46, 61]` correctly +1-shifted.

<summary><b>Patch 15  -  local fix: thread <code>chat_template_kwargs</code> through <code>/v1/responses</code></b></summary>

- **Status**: not yet filed upstream  -  worth a vLLM PR; the gap looks accidental.
- **Why we patch**: vLLM's `ResponsesRequest` (in `vllm/entrypoints/openai/responses/protocol.py`) had no `chat_template_kwargs` field at all, and `to_chat_params()` hard-coded `merge_kwargs({}, dict(...))`, ignoring user input. Effect on Qwen3.6: clients that send `chat_template_kwargs: {"enable_thinking": false}` to `/v1/responses` got reasoning anyway, while the same kwarg worked on `/v1/chat/completions` (different code path).
- **Diff**: 6+ / 1- across 1 file - `vllm/entrypoints/openai/responses/protocol.py`. Two anchors:
  - **15a**: adds `chat_template_kwargs: dict[str, Any] | None = None` field to `ResponsesRequest`, sandwiched between `user` and `skip_special_tokens`.
  - **15b**: in `to_chat_params()`, replaces `merge_kwargs({}, dict(...))` with `merge_kwargs(self.chat_template_kwargs or {}, dict(...))`. User-supplied kwargs flow through; vLLM's hardcoded keys (`add_generation_prompt`, `continue_final_message`, `reasoning_effort`) keep precedence.
- **What it does NOT fix**: the routing of model output channels in *non-streaming* `/v1/responses` when `enable_thinking=false`. That requires porting `prompt_is_reasoning_end` from `chat_completion/serving.py` to `responses/serving.py` (separate, larger architectural patch). For this repo we only support and verify the **streaming** path  -  see [Verified streaming behavior](#-verified-streaming-behavior-with-patch-15) below.
- **Verified live**: `python3 test/verify_responses_streaming.py`. T1-T4 (think_off variants) all show 0 chars in the `reasoning_text` channel, content correctly routed to `output_text` or parsed `function_call` items. T5 control (think_on) confirms reasoning still routes to `reasoning_text` when expected.

<summary><b>14 hardware-enablement patches from kyuz0 (verbatim)</b></summary>

`scripts/patch_strix.py` patches 1-12 are kept verbatim from [kyuz0/amd-strix-halo-vllm-toolboxes](https://github.com/kyuz0/amd-strix-halo-vllm-toolboxes) (Donato Capitella, the de-facto Strix Halo + vLLM stack maintainer). They handle:
- `amdsmi` disable + `MagicMock` (Strix Halo APUs don't expose amdsmi in containers)
- Force gfx1151 detection where vLLM falls back to gfx1100
- Disable AITER FP8 linear / fused MoE / RMSNorm on gfx1x (CDNA-only assembly)
- AITER chip_info JIT path fix
- `flash_attn_interface.py` soft-import (resilience to AITER JIT failures)
- Triton MoE kernel cap (allow gfx11xx)
- ROCM-21812 APU VRAM dynamic margin (50% VRAM clamp workaround)
- Misc: `hipCtx*` warnings, `qwen35` GGUF arch alias, Triton `AttrsDescriptor.__repr__`

These are gfx1151-driven, not quant-driven. Same patches the BF16 sibling repo uses.

## 🔍 vs official vLLM 0.20.0 ROCm support

The table below compares what vLLM 0.20.0 ships out-of-the-box for ROCm versus what this repo actually uses. Official vLLM targets data-center MI300/MI325 GPUs first; RDNA APU support is "works but not optimized" level. This repo is the opposite: gfx1151-only, stripped of all multi-GPU/datacenter features.

### GPU & SDK

| Component | Official vLLM 0.20.0 | This repo |
|---|---|---|
| Supported GPUs | MI300A/X/325X (gfx94x), RX 7900 XTX (gfx1100), Strix Point (gfx1150), Strix Halo (gfx1151), RX 9070 XT (gfx1201) | Strix Halo (gfx1151) only |
| Device detection | Built-in mapping table, auto-detect via amdsmi/torch.cuda | Patch-forced `HSA_OVERRIDE_GFX_VERSION=11.5.1` |
| ROCm version | 7.2.1 (stable release) | TheRock 7.13 nightly (unofficial) |
| Base image | `rocm/dev-ubuntu-22.04:7.2.1-complete` | Ubuntu 26.04 + TheRock nightly tarball |
| Python management | pip | `uv` |

### Attention backends

| Backend | Official vLLM 0.20.0 | This repo | Note |
|---|---|---|---|
| **ROCM_ATTN** (default) | Paged attention + Triton prefix prefill | LM main model | Natively supported |
| **TRITON_ATTN** (fallback) | Pure Triton attention | ViT vision encoder | Forced manually; auto backend produces NaN/Inf on gfx1151 |
| ROCM_AITER_FA | AITER flash attention | Disabled | AITER requires gfx9 (MI300+); gfx1151 unsupported |
| ROCM_AITER_UNIFIED_ATTN | AITER unified attention | Disabled | Same |
| TURBOQUANT | Quantized attention | Not used | |
| FLASH_ATTN | Dao-AILab flash-attention | Disabled | ViT 2.2-3.7x regression on gfx1151 |

### Quantization

| Method | Official vLLM 0.20.0 | This repo |
|---|---|---|
| AWQ | Supported via `VLLM_USE_TRITON_AWQ=1` | `conch-triton-kernels` (AWQMarlin-on-ROCm path) |
| GPTQ | Supported | Not used |
| FP8 (FNUZ) | gfx94x only | N/A (Strix Halo has no FP8) |
| Compressed-tensors | Supported | AWQ runtime path |
| GGUF | Supported | Not used (Patch 11 adds qwen35 alias) |
| BitsAndBytes | Supported | Excluded |
| MXFP4 / TorchAO / Quark | Supported | Not used |

### AITER components

All AITER features are **disabled** in this repo because `is_aiter_found_and_supported()` in official vLLM checks `on_mi3xx()` — AITER kernels are CDNA-only (gfx94x/gfx95x) and physically cannot run on RDNA (gfx11xx/gfx12xx). The official default is `VLLM_ROCM_USE_AITER=False` anyway.

| AITER feature | Official default | This repo |
|---|---|---|
| Linear / GEMM | `True` (but guarded by `on_mi3xx()`) | `VLLM_ROCM_USE_AITER=0` |
| MoE fused ops | `True` | Disabled |
| RMSNorm | `True` | Disabled |
| MLA decode | `True` | Disabled (DeepSeek-only) |
| MHA / flash attention | `True` | Disabled |
| FP8 / FP4 BMM | `True` | Disabled |

### Speculative decoding

| Method | Official vLLM 0.20.0 | This repo |
|---|---|---|
| Eagle/Eagle3 | Supported (tested with AITER MLA) | Not used |
| **DFlash** | Supported | Core optimization driver (+340% throughput) |
| N-gram | Supported (via numba) | Not used |
| Medusa | Supported | Not used |
| SWA in DFlash drafter | PR #40898 (open upstream) | Patch 14 cherry-pick |
| Non-causal attention on ROCM_ATTN | PR #40176 (merged to main, not in v0.20.0 tag) | Patch 13 cherry-pick |

### Communication & parallelism

| Component | Official vLLM 0.20.0 | This repo |
|---|---|---|
| Custom all-reduce | MI300 series (gfx94x/gfx95x) | N/A (single iGPU) |
| RCCL / NCCL | UCX + RIXL + rocshmem + DeepEP | Excluded (single GPU) |
| MORI expert parallelism | Supported (with AMD AINIC) | N/A |
| NUMA-aware detection | Supported | Not used |

### Docker build

| Aspect | Official vLLM 0.20.0 | This repo |
|---|---|---|
| Stages | 4 (vLLM / UCX / DeepEP / MORI proxy) | Single stage |
| Network acceleration | UCX + RIXL + DeepEP + MORI | None |
| Flash Attention | Dao-AILab, fixed commit, built from source | Installed but disabled at runtime |
| AITER | v0.1.10.post3, built from source | Not installed |
| Triton | ROCm fork, fixed commit | Triton 3.6 (nightly gfx1151 wheel) |

### 20 patches — upstream status

| Patches | Source | Content | Upstream status |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1-12 | kyuz0/amd-strix-halo-vllm-toolboxes | gfx1151 hardware enablement (amdsmi disable, arch detection, CDNA-only feature guards, JIT path fixes, APU VRAM margin, etc.) | Partially merged; some still pending |

## ⚠️ Honest limitations

- **`.env.template` defaults to single-stream** (`--max-num-seqs 1`). Multi-stream (up to **3 concurrent verified** in this session, see [profiles](#recommended-profiles) and [stress test](#-multi-stream--tool-calling-stress-test-3-concurrent)) works fine, just bump `VLLM_MAX_NUM_SEQS` and lower `MAX_MODEL_LEN`/`GPU_MEMORY_UTIL` to give the KV pool enough room.
- **Drafter is gated** on HuggingFace - manual approval required, no ungated mirror.
- **Tool calling has two working modes and two broken modes.** Streaming tool calls on `/v1/chat/completions` have upstream parser bugs (vLLM PRs #40785, #40787 closed unmerged); non-streaming `/v1/responses` + tools when combined with `enable_thinking=false` is broken locally (channel routing, see Patch 15 scope below). Use `/v1/chat/completions` with `stream: false`, OR `/v1/responses` with `stream: true`. Full breakdown in [the tool calling support matrix](#%EF%B8%8F-tool-calling-support-matrix).
- **Cold start ≈ 9 min on every restart**, even with all caches warm. Full breakdown in the dedicated [Spin-up time section](#%EF%B8%8F-spin-up-time-is-9-min-on-every-restart-even-with-all-caches-warm) above.
- **DFlash acceptance drops past N≈8** (drafter is less accurate further ahead). N=15 may give marginal further gain; we stopped at N=8 (best steady-state on chat is 19.8 t/s, on `/v1/responses` is 24.8).
- **Numbers in this README are wall-clock client-side.** vLLM internal generation throughput is ≈ 25-27 t/s on these workloads (engine excludes round-trip + initial prefill).
- **HIP graphs freeze on gfx1151** - `--enforce-eager` mandatory.
- **Official `Qwen/Qwen3.6-27B-FP8` doesn't init** on RDNA 3.5 (Triton w8a8 autotune stall on the hybrid model's DeltaNet partitions). AWQ-INT4 sidesteps this and is structurally a better fit since RDNA 3.5 has no native FP8 anyway.
- **Non-streaming `/v1/responses` with `enable_thinking=false` is NOT patched in this repo.** Patch 15 only covers the streaming path. The non-streaming path still misroutes content into the `reasoning` field and leaves tool-call XML unparsed. Use `stream: true` on `/v1/responses` for any agent or RAG client.

### 🚨 vLLM v0.20.0 qwen3 reasoning parser DOES NOT STREAM REASONING on `/v1/chat/completions`

Confirmed bug - independent of DFlash, present even without spec decode. With `--reasoning-parser qwen3` enabled and `stream: true`:

- **`/v1/chat/completions`**: parser **buffers** all `<think>...</think>` content server-side, emits **zero** `delta.reasoning_content` chunks during the stream. Client sees a long "ttft" silence (~10-30 s of thinking) and then a burst of the post-thinking answer at the end.
- **`/v1/responses`**: streams correctly - `response.reasoning_text.delta` events arrive at t+0.33 s, then `response.output_text.delta` after `</think>`. Same engine, same DFlash, same numbers. Different code path that actually works.

Verified via direct curl probe in this repo (`stream:true`, simple math prompt):

| Endpoint | `reasoning` deltas during stream | First delta arrives |
|---|---|---|
| `/v1/chat/completions` | **0** | t+12.52 s (just the post-think answer) |
| `/v1/responses` | **62** | **t+0.33 s** ✅ |

**Workaround for end-user clients that need streaming reasoning visible:**
- **Use `/v1/responses`** - fully working today, recommended.
- Alternatively disable the parser (remove `--reasoning-parser qwen3` from `docker-compose.yml`) and let raw `<think>...</think>` text stream as part of `delta.content`. Tradeoff: `/v1/responses` no longer auto-separates reasoning into structured `output[].type == "reasoning"` items.
- Or accept it: send `stream: false` on chat completions when you need to display reasoning.

The included `glados.py` uses `/v1/responses` to dodge the bug.

This is worth filing upstream - the qwen3 parser's streaming path appears to never call `extract_reasoning_content_streaming` correctly on the chat-completions code path. Affects every model using `--reasoning-parser qwen3`, not just DFlash workloads.

> **Transparency note**: this is the issue we hit and verified. There are almost certainly **other** vLLM v0.20.0 quirks we did not exercise - long-context corner cases, edge sampler params, multimodal + tools combinations, prefix-cache edge cases, etc. We only documented what our bench surfaced. If you run a workload mode we didn't test (different drafter, different attention backend, hybrid grad cudagraph, etc.) and hit something weird, the right move is *not* "the repo is broken" but "vLLM v0.20.0 is early on this code path - check upstream issues, file if new". DFlash + reasoning-parser + ROCm-on-RDNA3.5 are all simultaneously in active flux upstream as of 2026-04-26.

### ✅ Verified streaming behavior with Patch 15

Originally `chat_template_kwargs.enable_thinking=false` was silently ignored on `/v1/responses` (vLLM's `ResponsesRequest` had no field for it; the renderer received an empty kwargs dict). **Local Patch 15** wires the field through and re-runs prove the kwarg now flows correctly.

The Qwen3.6 chat template (verbatim from `chat_template.jinja:148-152`):

```jinja
{%- if add_generation_prompt %}
    {{- '<|im_start|>assistant\n' }}
    {%- if enable_thinking is defined and enable_thinking is false %}
        {{- '<think>\n\n</think>\n\n' }}        ← empty think block prefilled
    {%- else %}
        {{- '<think>\n' }}                       ← open think tag, model thinks
    {%- endif %}
{%- endif %}
```

When `enable_thinking=false` reaches the template, it injects a closed `<think></think>` at the start of the assistant turn. The model's first generated token is therefore *past* the closed think block: it physically cannot emit reasoning. Reasoning is **genuinely skipped, not hidden** - latency drops accordingly.

**Verification matrix** (`python3 test/verify_responses_streaming.py`, all five tests on the running engine):

| Test | Setup | Reasoning chars | Output text chars | Tool result | Wall | Verdict |
|---|---|---:|---:|---|---:|---|
| T1 | tiny prompt, no tools, `think_off` | 0 | 2 (`"42"`) | n/a | 0.47 s | ✅ |
| T2 | tiny prompt, with tools, `think_off` | 0 | 0 | `get_weather({"city":"Tokyo"})` parsed | 3.34 s | ✅ |
| T3 | ~2K context, no tools, `think_off` | 0 | 100 (correct synthesis answer) | n/a | 7.92 s | ✅ |
| T4 | ~2K context, with tools, `think_off` | 0 | 0 | `get_weather({"city":"Santa Clara"})` parsed | 12.52 s | ✅ |
| T5 | tiny, no tools, `think_ON` (control) | 354 | 4 (`"\n\n42"`) | n/a | 6.13 s | ✅ |

T5 proves the channel routing is preserved when reasoning IS expected: with thinking on, the `reasoning_text` channel populates and the `output_text` channel still gets the final answer. With thinking off (T1-T4), `reasoning_text` is empty across both no-tool and tool variants and across both tiny and 2K-context prompts.

**One known gap deliberately left out of scope**: non-streaming `/v1/responses` (i.e. `stream=false`) with `enable_thinking=false` still misroutes content into the `reasoning_text` field, and tool-call XML stays raw inside that field instead of being parsed into `function_call` items. The fix is a separate, larger patch (port `prompt_is_reasoning_end` from `chat_completion/serving.py`). For this repo we **only support the streaming path** on `/v1/responses`. Always send `stream: true` and the engine behaves correctly.

**Practical client guidance**:
- For fast non-thinking responses on `/v1/responses`: send `stream: true` + `chat_template_kwargs: {"enable_thinking": false}`. Patch 15 makes this work end-to-end.
- For streaming reasoning visible to a UI: send `stream: true` and omit the kwarg (default thinking on); reasoning arrives as `response.reasoning_text.delta` events.
- Patch 15 should land upstream as a vLLM PR  -  the gap looks accidental and the fix is six lines.

### 🚨 DFlash speculative decoding is *early upstream - fragile path*

DFlash landed in vLLM main on **2026-03-30** ([PR #36847](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/pull/36847)). As of the time of this README, **5+ DFlash bug-fix PRs are still open** and several DFlash-class bug reports are unresolved across multiple GPU vendors (NVIDIA, AMD, both):

| Open issue / PR | Title | Vendor | Why it matters here |
|---|---|---|---|
| [#39928](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/issues/39928) | Qwen3.5 DFlash gives strange responses on SM90 | NVIDIA H100 | Confirms DFlash output-quality bugs are not unique to AMD |
| [#40624](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/issues/40624) | Gemma4 0% prefix cache hits with hybrid attention + DFlash | All | Hybrid (DeltaNet-style) attention + DFlash interaction is the same class as our Qwen 3.6-27B target |
| [#40382](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/issues/40382) | Gemma-4 + DFlash unservable on Ampere - non-causal + head_dim=256 has no compatible attention backend | NVIDIA A100 | DFlash needs `supports_non_causal=True` backends; not all backends qualify (this is exactly what our Patch 13 fixes for `ROCM_ATTN`) |
| [#40425](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/pull/40425) | Fix quantized DFlash Qwen3 draft support | All | Open PR fixing quantized drafter loading |
| [#40334](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/pull/40334) | fix(dflash): dtype mismatch in `combine_hidden_states` | All | Open PR fixing a dtype bug in the auxiliary-hidden-state path |
| [#40727](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/pull/40727) | Update dflash aux layer indexing | All | Related to the same `+1` shift bug our Patch 14d (PR #40898) addresses |
| [#40632](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/issues/40632) | Support DFlash for Kimi K2.5 and Qwen3.5-27B for AMD | AMD | The umbrella issue for AMD-side DFlash support - our work plugs into this |

**Bottom line: DFlash is not "stable upstream" yet on any vendor.** It works for our specific Qwen 3.6-27B + AWQ4 + N=8 path because we've patched around the issues we hit, but you may encounter unfixed-upstream behaviors not seen here, especially with different drafters, different N values, or different attention backends.

If output quality looks off (incoherent, repetitive, garbled), **first try `--speculative-config '{"method":"dflash", ..., "num_speculative_tokens":1}'`** - that's the safest setting; it isolates whether the issue is DFlash itself vs the multi-token spec-decode path.

<details>
<summary><b>Stuck DFlash worker on client disconnect - what we hit during the long-context test (recovery documented)</b></summary>

**Symptom (we hit it once during ~22K-token long-context decode):** if the client TCP-disconnects mid-decode while `--speculative-config method=dflash` is active, the EngineCore worker may not gracefully unwind. The API server (`/health`, `/v1/models`) stays responsive but new `/v1/chat/completions` requests time out forever. EngineCore burns 79-200% CPU in a tight loop. Kernel logs:

```
workqueue: kfd_process_wq_release [amdgpu] hogged CPU for >10000us 5 times,
consider switching to WQ_UNBOUND
```

**Likely cause:** a refcount / cancel race between the DFlash proposer thread and the KFD GPU buffer release path when a request is cancelled mid-decode. The DFlash worker keeps running while the client cancellation tries (and fails) to reclaim its buffers. Plausibly related to the open issues table above - DFlash's cancellation/cleanup path is not yet hardened upstream.

**Recovery:** `docker compose restart vllm-awq4-qwen` (≈ 9 min cold boot). Run `./scripts/dump_logs.sh stuck-state` *before* the restart to preserve diagnostics for an upstream report.

**Mitigation while waiting for upstream fix:**
- Prefer client-side timeouts larger than your expected decode time
- Avoid `SIGKILL`'ing the client mid-stream - use `SIGINT` or wait for graceful completion
- For very long-context requests (>10K prompt tokens), consider testing with `num_speculative_tokens=1` first to confirm baseline correctness, then ramp up

If you reproduce this, file under the [DFlash umbrella tracker (#40632)](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/issues/40632) with output of `./scripts/dump_logs.sh`.

🟧 **You found the secret CLI.** Once your engine is running:

```bash
docker compose up -d
# wait for: "Application startup complete" in `docker logs -f vllm-awq4-qwen`

./glados.py                       # interactive REPL with Aperture banner + a random GLaDOS quote
./glados.py "explain mitosis"     # one-shot
```

In the REPL: type your prompt and hit Enter. Streams `<thinking>...</thinking>` live (via the `/v1/responses` path that actually works), then the answer, then a one-line stats summary: `prompt→output tokens · wall time · wall t/s · vLLM ground-truth t/s · DFlash acceptance %`.

To leave: `exit`, `quit`, `:q`, or `Ctrl-D`. To abort an in-flight generation without leaving: `Ctrl-C`.

The banner shows in **Aperture orange** in your terminal (markdown above can't render true color, but `glados.py` uses ANSI 208 in the actual TTY).
